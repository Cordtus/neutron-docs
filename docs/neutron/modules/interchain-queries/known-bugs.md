### Impossibility to retrieve and prove KV data with nil values

Due to a [bug](https://github.com/cosmos/ics23/issues/134) in ICS23 package, it's currently impossible to query an empty or `nil` value from a remote chain. Meaning if your KV-query is registered with key `K` and a value under this key is `nil` or empty, submission of such KV result will fail due to IAVL-proof verification error: `failed to verify proof: empty value in membership proof`. Moreover, due to [the nature of IAVL-proofs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/ae77f0080a724b159233bd9b289b2e91c0de21b5/docs/interfaces/lite/specification.md) (which is an underlying mechanism of verification of a validity of KV-queries results), it's also impossible to verify [IAVL-absence proof](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/ae77f0080a724b159233bd9b289b2e91c0de21b5/docs/interfaces/lite/specification.md#iavl-absence-proof) if it contains IAVL-proof with `nil` or empty value: `failed to verify proof: could not verify absence of key. Please ensure that the path is correct.`. We are in contact with ics23 team to fix this issue ASAP, but in the meantime the only way to deal with the bug is to avoid querying keys with `nil` or empty values.

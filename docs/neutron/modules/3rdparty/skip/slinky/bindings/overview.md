# Overview
We have integrated the [Slinky](https://docs.skip.money/slinky/overview) modules (Oracle & MarketMap) into the Neutron and added WASM bindings to facilitate their usage. This integration enhances our blockchain with reliable, real-time price feeds and market data.
Using `neutron-sdk` you can query these modules via contracts.

# Overview

This document specifies the Interchain Transactions module for the Neutron network.

The Interchain Transactions module manages the creation of IBC Accounts and executing interchain transactions on behalf
of CosmWasm smart contracts. The current implementation allows a smart contract to:

1. Register multiple interchain accounts on a remote zone using an existing IBC connection;
2. Execute transactions with multiple messages on a remote zone;
3. Process the `OnChanOpenAck`, `Acknowledgement` and `Timeout` events as they are delivered by a relayer.

## IBC events

Registering an interchain account or executing an interchain transaction are asynchronous actions. In most cases, the
respective handlers of the Interchain Transactions module immediately return an empty successful response. The "real"
response (with information about the status of execution on a remote zone) is later delivered in a separate IBC packet
by a relayer. We call such packets the **IBC events**.

A smart contract that tries to register an interchain account or to execute an interchain transaction naturally expects
to receive the IBC events related to these actions. The Interchain Transactions module solves this task by passing these
IBC events to the smart contract using
a [Sudo() call](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/288609255ad92dfe5c54eae572fe7d6010e712eb/x/wasm/keeper/keeper.go#L453)
and a custom [message scheme](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/blob/v2.0.0/x/contractmanager/types/sudo.go). You can find a
complete list of IBC events for each module message in the [messages](./messages) section.

## Sudo errors handling

Interchaintxs module configured the following way, all the errors from a sudo handler are being suppressed by [contract manager middleware](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#concepts), sudo handler is limited with [LIMIT](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#gas-limitation) amount of gas

## Importing interchaintxs module

If you use interchaintxs module in your application and if your Sudo handler fails, the acknowledgment will be marked as processed inside the IBC module anyway, without any notes about an error saved into the store. This will make the IBC relayers to successfully submit the acknowledgment and get the fees.

> **Note** You can use a [contracts manager](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#concepts) SudoLimitWrapper as a wrapper for SudoKeeper,
> exactly like neutron [configured](#sudo-errors-handling) the module
>
> **Note** We strongly recommend developers to write Sudo handlers very carefully and keep them as simple as possible. If you do
> want to have elaborate logic in your handler, you should verify the acknowledgement data before making any state
> changes; that way you can, if the data received with the acknowledgement is incompatible with executing the handler
> logic normally, return an `Ok()` response immediately, which will prevent the acknowledgement from being resubmitted.
>
> **Note**: there is no dedicated event for a closed channel (ICA disables all messages related to closing the channels)
> . Your channel, however, can still be closed if a packet timeout occurs; thus, if you are notified about a packet
> timeout, you can be sure that the affected channel was closed. Please note that it is generally a good practice to set
> the packet timeout for your interchain transactions to a really large value.
>
> If the timeout occurs anyway, you can just
> execute [RegisterInterchainAccount message]( /neutron/modules/interchain-txs/messages#msgregisterinterchainaccount) again to
> recover access to your interchain account.
> **Note** Keep in mind, new channel is created

## Relaying

Neutron introduces smart-contract level callbacks for IBC packets. From an IBC relayer's perspective, this means that
custom application logic can be executed when a packet is submitted to Neutron, which can potentially drain the
relayer's funds. This naturally brings us to a situation in which protocols would prefer to set up their own relayers
and restrict the channels they are willing to relay for. For example,
in [Hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs) you can do this by adding a `chains.packet_filter` config:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
    # allow relaying only for chanels created by a certain contract  
    ['icacontroller-neutron14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s5c2epq*', '*'],
]
```

> Note: you can have a look at the `MsgRegisterInterchainQuery` documentation in the [Messages](messages.md) chapter
> to learn how IBC port naming works.

Please refer to the [IBC Relaying](../../../relaying/ibc-relayer.md) section for full IBC relaying documentation.
